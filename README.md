# Machine Learning Notes
In broad terms, machine learning is a specialized subfield of artificial intelligence that leverages a diverse set of techniques and draws on knowledge from multiple mathematical domains—including statistics, linear algebra, calculus, and optimization theory—to enable computers to identify patterns, make predictions, and solve complex problems that are often intractable or inefficient to address using traditional, explicitly programmed algorithmic methods. By learning from data and improving performance over time without being explicitly programmed for every specific task, machine learning systems have become fundamental to advancements in various fields such as natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, and decision-making systems.

These brief informal notes aim to concisely—but not exhaustively—illustrate some mathematical aspects of machine learning. The emphasis is on general mathematical conceptualization, attempting to provide a precise formulation of machine learning principles and concepts.

The need to write these notes arises from the fact that the fundamental concepts of the discipline are scattered across various sources—books, papers, and articles—that often employ different terminologies, notations, and modes of reasoning. This diversity can make it challenging for scientists who are not specialists in these areas to develop a unified and coherent understanding of the underlying principles. By consolidating and clarifying these core ideas in a single, accessible resource, these notes aim to facilitate interdisciplinary learning and foster a deeper comprehension of the subject.

Then, these notes aim to bridge the existing gap by offering readers a unified and concise overview of the foundational concepts. Their purpose is to provide a clear and synthetic summary that facilitates understanding and prepares readers for more advanced study. However, they are not meant to substitute authoritative papers and comprehensive textbooks, which provide more in-depth explanations, rigorous proofs, and extensive examples.

These notes do not explain the mathematical fundamentals of the discipline—such as analysis, linear algebra, probability—because it is assumed that the reader is a competent scientist with an appropriate level of mathematical knowledge. This audience may include mathematicians, physicists, engineers, or other professionals who already possess a solid foundation in these areas, allowing the material to focus on the specific arguments pertaining to the discipline.

Additionally, these notes do not address the practical implementation of mathematical techniques through specific programming languages, frameworks, or libraries. Consequently, readers seeking hands-on guidance for coding, algorithm development, or applying these mathematical concepts in real-world software environments may need to consult supplementary resources or tutorials focused on practical programming applications.
